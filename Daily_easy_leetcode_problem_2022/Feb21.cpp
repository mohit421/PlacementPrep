//  Problem:- Majority Voting Problem:



/*

Using unordered Map | Majority Voting Solution

I First try with stl function :- **std::count(firstIterator, lastIterator,val) ** --> It's time complexity is O(n).
It's Brute force solution --> we can do by using count function in stl but this give TLE:- Most of the test cases are passed.
So I try it using unordered_map below it's solution
1st we count it's each occourence and store it mpp and return when mpp[x] > n/2 as it is given in description .

// The standard guarantees
- From the C++11/14 standard, std::sort is guaranteed to have:
Complexity: O(N log(N)) (where N == last - first) comparisons.

- The other, stable, standard sorting algorithm (namely std::stable_sort) is guaranteed to have:
Complexity: It does at most N logÂ²(N) (where N == last - first) comparisons; if enough extra memory is available,
 it is N log(N).

- For std::forward_list::stable, instead:

Complexity: Approximately N log(N) comparisons, where N is distance(begin(), end()).

- The same goes for std::list:

Complexity: Approximately N log(N) comparisons, where N == size().

//  Another discussion Solution

/*

- time complexity is o(n) and space complexity is o(1)

We use the **Moore Vooting Algorithm**

The basic thinking is that we need to pair the distinct elements and once all the elements are paired , the left out element may be the potential answer

Eg 1) - nums = [3,2,3]
Here we pair 3 and 2 and the left out element which is 3 may be the potential answer

Eg 2) - nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Here three 1's are paired with three 2's and 2 is left . Therefore it is the answer

//  Implementation part

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
      int value = nums[0];   // initialize value with 1st element of the array
        int count = 1;          // therefore the count is 1
        for(int i = 1 ; i < nums.size() ; i++)
        {
            if(value==nums[i])
            {
                count++;     // if the value is equal to nums[i] , means the consecutive elements are same so increase the value of count
            }
            else
            {
                count--;  // if the value is not equal to nums[i] , means the consecutive elements are not same so pair them and decrease the value of count by 1
            }
            if(count==0)   // this means the pairing of the elements till the ith element of the array is done and now we have a new value which is not paired with any element
            {                      // for eg in nums = [3,2,3] when we reach the last element count is zero so , the new value now becomes 3 (last element) and it is not paired with any element 
                value = nums[i];    
                count = 1;
